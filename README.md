# Programmable Positive Voltage Regulator with Protection Features
Designed and implemented a programmable linear voltage regulator using discrete components, ensuring a stable and adjustable 20V–22V output within a 25V–28V input range.
Incorporated foldback current limiting and overvoltage suppression for enhanced reliability. Simulated performance using LTSpice and validated the final prototype under real operating conditions.
Tools Used: Bipolar Junction Transistors, Zener Diodes, LTSpice, Breadboard.
